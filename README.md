# Data Structures in C

Welcome to the **Data Structures in C** repository! This repository contains implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms using the **C programming language**. The focus is on providing clear and efficient code for various data structures with variations, helping others learn and implement them.

## Data Structures Implemented

This repository includes the following data structures and their variations:

### 1. **Stack**
   - Stack (Basic)
   - Stack using Arrays
   - Stack using Linked List

### 2. **Queue**
   - Queue (Basic)
   - Queue using Arrays
   - Queue using Linked List
   - Circular Queue
   - Priority Queue
   - Doubly Ended Queue

### 3. **Linked List**
   - Singly Linked List
   - Doubly Linked List
   - Circular Linked List

### 4. **Binary Trees**
   - Insertion, Deletion, Searching and Traversals (Preorder, Inorder, Postorder)

### 5. **Hashing**
   - Hash Tables (with Collision Handling using Chaining and Open Addressing)

### 6. **Adjacency Matrices**
   - Representation of Graphs using Adjacency Matrices
   - Depth First Search (DFS) and Breadth First Search (BFS)
